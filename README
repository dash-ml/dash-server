ML-dash replaces visdom and tensorboard. It allows you to see real-time
updates, review 1000+ of experiments quickly, and dive in-depth into
individual experiments with minimum mental effort.

-  **Parallel Coordinates**
-  **Aggregating Over Multiple Runs (with different seeds)**
-  **Preview Videos, ``matplotlib`` figures, and images.**

Usage
-----

To make sure you **install** the newest version of ``ml_dash``:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda install pycurl
   pip install ml-logger ml-dash --upgrade --no-cache

Just doing this would not work. The landscape of python modules is a lot
messier than that of javascript. The most up-to-date graphene requires
the following versioned dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

   yes | pip install graphene==2.1.3
   yes | pip install graphql-core==2.1
   yes | pip install graphql-relay==0.4.5
   yes | pip install graphql-server-core==1.1.1

There are two servers:

1. a server that serves the static web-application files ``ml_dash.app``

   This is just a static server that serves the web application client.

   To run this:

   .. code-block:: bash

      python -m ml_dash.app

2. the visualization backend ``ml_dash.server``

   This server usually lives on your logging server. It offers a
   ``graphQL`` API backend for the dashboard client.

   .. code-block:: bash

      python -m ml_dash.server --logdir=my/folder

   **Note: the server accepts requests from ``localhost`` only by
   default for safety reasons.** To overwrite this, see the
   documentation here:
   `ml-dash-tutorial <https://ml-logger.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setting_up.html#ml-dash-tutorial>`__
